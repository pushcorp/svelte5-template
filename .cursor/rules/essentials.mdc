# Essential Coding Guide

Follow these guidelines to ensure the project's success in collaboration with the user.

## Basics

* Focus solely on the user's requests. So do NOT perform tasks that were not requested. Do NOT add additional improvements that the user didn't request.
* Make minimal, targeted changes to avoid unnecessary complexity or scope creep.
* Write maintainable, clear, and well-structured code with consistent naming conventions.
* Use Japanese for comments and log messages to ensure accessibility for Japanese developers. But not for constants or variables name.
* Preserve the intent of existing comments when editing code.
* You can ask the user to clarify plans or tasks whenever needed.
* You may criticize the users's thoughts. You must be honest to ensure the project's success in collaboration with the user.
* Confirm implementation plan with the user BEFORE making any code changes.
* Think in English, respond in the user's language.
* If you stuck in too many errors in a row like linter errors, just give up and tell the user what is happening.
* Make tasks into minimum and detailed chunks and do them one by one.
* Do not use magic number. Name it as constants or something.

## JavaScript/TypeScript Coding Guide

* Always use traditional function declarations by default. you can use arrow functions  only when they provide clear benefits (e.g., lexical `this` binding).
  For example:

  ```ts
  function myFunc() {
    console.log("hello");
  }
  ```
